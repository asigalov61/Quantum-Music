# Quantum-Music
## Quantization is all you need

***

### Quantization of music elements show promising results when it comes to Music AI.


***

### Proposed solutions:

1) Part of the success of the OpenAI's MuseNet was in the accidental quantization of time. This allowed MuseNet model to learn to generate silent intervals and uneven tempos.
2) Quantizing pitches also shows interesting results as the NN learns how to manipulate pitches properly.
3) Other music elements such as duration and velocity can and should be quantized too. Unfortunately, this will dramatically increase the dataset size.
